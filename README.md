git push --set-upstream origin YOUR_BRANCH_NAME
```

Try not to merge changes yourself to master unless you're 100% sure it's both correct and won't mess up the git workflow. Changes will be reviewed and merged onto the master, this lets us not interfere with each other and have a detailed history of who did what and when so any mistakes can be backtracked efficiently.
